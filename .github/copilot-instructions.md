SmartDeno is a template using Deno in TypeScript.

We are using the following Deno libraries: Deno KV as a Key-Value store; Oak Application Server for serving HTTP, with Oak Sessions to handle user sessions; ETA as HTML template engine; DyeLog logger.

We are using Bootstrap 5.3 as our UI framework.

The code is intended to be fully compatible with Deno and Deno Deploy. We try to make this template fully adherent to the latest Deno guidelines, including using Deno JSR repository as much as possible.
